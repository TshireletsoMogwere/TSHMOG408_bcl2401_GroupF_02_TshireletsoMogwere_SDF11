# Presentation Talking Points

# Slide 1: Introduction
**Talking Points:**
My name is Tshireletso Mogwere and I created a Cache Bank business landing page to demonstrate my ability to create a professional, functional landing page, showcase my skills to potential employers as well for marketing purposes. I used HTML to structure my web page and its content such as inserting the containers, flexbox, grid while using tailwind css to style and position the content. I then used Javascript to make my web page interactive.

# Slide 2: Component 1 - Project Setup and Responsive Navigation
**Talking Points:**
A mobile-first design is a strategy that prioritizes designing and developing for mobile devices before scaling up to larger screens. CSS media queries adjust styles for tablets and larger mobile devices using min-width media queries. Enhance navigation for larger screens like desktops and laptops.
JavaScript function to toggle the visibility of the mobile menu when the toggle button is clicked. Allows users to access navigation links and other important features seamlessly on mobile devices. 
Using tailwind css I hid the navigation menu on larger screen so that it does not appear on smaller screens when open allowing it to display a vertical menu on smaller screens. I then displayed the element as a flex container, allowing flexible layout options.
Absolute: Positions the element absolutely within its containing element.
Overflow-Hidden: Conceals content that exceeds the element's boundaries.
Background Color: Sets the background color to white for better readability.

I used semantic HTML5 for: 
Improved accessibility so that screen readers and other assistive technologies can navigate the website more effectively with the elements.
Clearer Structure to enhances the readability and understanding of the webpage's structure, both for developers and users. Header: Use <header> to denote the header section containing navigation links. Button: <button> elements for interactive navigation components like dropdown menus.

# Slide 3: Component 2 - Hero and Endorsements
**Talking Points:**
I inserted endorsements to provide reassurance to consumers by associating the brand with trustworthy entities like Nike, Amazon, Minecraft, Notion and steam. This was to enhance the brand's reputation and credibility in the eyes of the audience and influence consumersâ€™ decisions so they can trust and be convinced to purchase or use services that are endorsed by the sources they perceive as credible.
The hero section of the website is prime real estate for engaging users and prompting action. I created a clear and a compelling CTA to capture users' attention and encourage them to take the desired action. It serves as a guiding beacon, directing users on the next steps to take and facilitating their journey through the website.
I styled it by inserting a flexbox to align the SVG icons horizontally. Media Queries: Adjusts gap spacing and flex item wrapping for responsive design.Icon Styling: Sets SVG fill color for visual consistency.

I used CSS Grid Layout to set grid columns by default one-column layout (grid-cols-1) spanning the entire width (w-full), vertically align the grid by centering it within its container (my-auto), adds margin space on top and bottom (mt-12 and mb-8) and to insert media queries for transitioning to a two-column layout for medium screens and above (md:grid-cols-2).
For the Flexbox Layout I inserted flex container to utilizes flexbox with items stacked in a column (flex flex-col), vertically center content and align it to the start on larger screens (justify-center and text-start) and applied font size, weight, line height, and color for readability and aesthetic appeal.
For the Image and Content Alignment I utilized the flexbox to hide the image on small screens (hidden md:flex), set the image width and adds rounded corners for a polished look and centered the  content horizontally and aligned it to the end of the container on larger screens (items-center justify-end).


# Slide 4: Component 3 - Features
**Talking Points:**
The Features Section is divided into individual feature blocks, each containing an icon, a title, and a description. It utilizes HTML <div> elements with appropriate classes for styling and layout.

Each feature block consists of an icon <div> and a content <div> for the title and description.

Icons are SVG images embedded within <div> elements with specific styling classes. They are centered vertically and horizontally within their containers. The feature blocks are arranged using CSS Grid, allowing for responsive layout adjustments.

The grid adapts to different screen sizes, displaying a single column on small screens and multiple columns on larger screens.
Accessibility in web applications is crucial for ensuring inclusivity and usability for all users, including those with disabilities so I used the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles provide a set of attributes to enhance the accessibility of web content for assistive technologies.


# Slide 5: Component 4 - Stats and Getting Started Section
**Talking Points:**
The stats are used to reflect the focus on efficiency and customer convenience.By streamlining processes, we empower our users to maximize their time, 
Cache optimization is crucial for enhancing website performance.Our efforts in cache management ensure smooth user experiences and faster load times.

There is a clean and clear layout to prioritize clarity, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the content.
Whitespace: Ample whitespace is used to prevent clutter and provide visual breathing room, enhancing readability.
There are eye-catching visuals like the background image that  grabs the user's attention, setting the tone for the user journey. The Icons to provide visual cues and aid comprehension, making the interface more intuitive.
There is Informative Content with concise headings that are descriptive, summarizing key information and guiding users through the process including informative text that t elaborates on each step, offering users insights into what to expect and how to proceed.

There is Responsive Grid Layout with adaptive grid to adjust responsively to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across devices as well as grid alignment and spacing to maintain visual consistency, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.Javascript is responsible for triggering the counting animation when the elements come into view. Typically, this involves using Intersection Observer or scroll event listeners to detect when the elements are visible on the screen, then dynamically updating the content of the <span> elements to animate from their initial value to the target value specified in the countto attribute.


# Slide 6: Component 5 - Contact and Footer
**Talking Points:**
I designed the footer by ensuring that it complements the overall website design while ensuring accessibility with its contrast and color to create sufficient contrast between the background color of the footer and the text color to aid readability, especially for users with visual impairments. I Used colors that align with the website's color scheme but maintain readability.

Contact Information: displayed information, such as email address, phone number, and physical address, in a clear and accessible format. 

Social Media Icons: included in the footer which are easily recognizable and clickable. Used descriptive alt text for each icon to provide context for users who may be using screen readers.

# Slide 7: Conclusion
**Talking Points:**
The objective of this project was to build a functional landing page using different components and this was done by using CSS, HTML and Javascript.

I learnt to build a professional website and that enhanced my problem solving skills, attention to details and being creative.
